# Analyze_AB_Test_Nanodegree_Udacity_Project_3

Introduction
A/B tests were conducted for this project in order to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The goal is to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page.

Part II - A/B Test
The null and alternative hypotheses, if we assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%

According to the analysis I performed, all results show that none of the variables have significant p-values. As there is no significant impact on conversion, I fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.

General recomendation: there are not enough sufficient evidences to suggest that the new page results in more conversions than the old page. The company should keep the old page.
